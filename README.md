# ush
ush is supposed to become a really small shell.

At the moment ist extremely limited in its functionality. It is possible to start programs by typing their full path (e.g. '/bin/echo') and to give parameters (e.g. '/bin/echo Hello World').

ush is my personal learning project and I will occasionally work on it if I feel like it, anyone who would use this may reconsider his sanity.
